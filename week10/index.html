    <h1>Week 10: Validating Forms and Using Fetch</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>MDN: Validating Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always validate input on the server side, AND the client side.</li>
            <li>Built-in form validation has been extremely important in the development of the modern web; use built-in validation when possible.</li>
            <li>Built-in form validation comes out of the HTML5 standard, and I largely documented this last week. You can use regular expressions, basic min/max, required, step, etc.</li>
            <li><span class="code">textarea</span> doesn't support regex without custom JS</li>
            <li>JS lets you handle invalid data differently from the built-in functionality. You can check if an input is valid by calling <span class="code">HTMLElement.validity</span>; Has a variety of enums for different reasons why the element is invalid.</li>
            <li>Use constraint validation API to customize visual validity errors. Using <span class="code">novalidate</span> will prevent the browser's default visual validity from displaying, use your own JS to set your own visual indicators.</li>
            <li>For custom controls (for example, a calendar) you will need to validate the control yourself. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>MDN: Using Fetch</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use include to include cookies, credentials with a <span class="code">fetch()</span></li>
            <li>CORS is very restrictive, when disabling CORS you are unable to include very much</li>
            <li>Files can be uploaded using <span class="code">fetch()</span> and <span class="code">FormData</span>.</li>
            <li>Custom headers can be crafted for <span class="code">fetch()</span> requests by using the <span class="code">Headers</span> object.</li>
            <li>Fetch promises return a <span class="code">Response</span> object, which contains a <span class="code">Body</span> object which contains the data.</li>
        </ul>
