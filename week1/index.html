    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I didn't have very many notes for this week. The reading we were assigned to do was largely review, and I felt very comfortable with the topics it was discussing.</li>
      <li>Most of my work for this week was spent creating the home page listing the work I will complete in this class over the course of this semester.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not have any questions for this week, either.</li>
